## Authentication
All requests must have an `Authorization` http header with `Bearer <your-token-here>`.

*for development environment only*

The bearer token is a JSON Web Token and can be easily generated by running:
```sh
rake token
```

Or, pipe it directly to your clipboard:

```sh
rake token | pbcopy
```

###Creating your .env file

1. In your terminal, run the following command to create your .env file and copy the contents of the .env.sample to the new file:
```sh
 cp .env.sample .env
 ```

2. Go to the following link to generate an API token on GitHub:

https://github.com/settings/tokens

*When generating your token, give a brief description of what the token is for, but leave the options for scopes blanks.

3. Fill in the value in your .env file with the token that was generated.
```sh 
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<the-token-generated-from-github>
```
